# POC-Rest-API
This is a POC(Proof of Concept) backend marketplace-like REST API project, which tries to apply the concepts of unity testing, authentication and authorization with JWT Tokens, CRUD operations and database modelling in a relational database (MySQL) using layered application architecture and Java as programming language.

A documentation of the API and its endpoints can be found [here.](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11450721/TVzREczv)
